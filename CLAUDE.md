# Task: Scaffold PCB cost estimation project structure

## Instructions
Set up the Python project structure with pyproject.toml/setup.cfg, directory layout (src/pcb_cost_estimator/, tests/, data/), CLI entry point using Click or argparse, configuration management (YAML/JSON config for API keys, model parameters, markup percentages), and basic logging infrastructure. Include a requirements.txt with initial dependencies (pandas, pydantic, openai/anthropic SDK, click, pyyaml).

## Acceptance Criteria

* Project directory structure created with src/, tests/, data/, config/ directories
* CLI entry point runs with --help without error
* Configuration loader reads from YAML/JSON config file
* Logging is configured and outputs to console/file
* Virtual environment setup instructions in README

**Complexity:** low
